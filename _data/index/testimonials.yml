  message: I worked with Aanand and his team on a web/mobile app project in 2017. I was very impressed with Aanandâ€™s professionalism and willingness to work around issues that occurred and solve problems that I didn't even consider. There was no challenge that I presented, that Aanand shied away from and he was able to deliver what I was looking for in the time frame he set. I will absolutely work with Aanand on future projects and highly recommend him if you need web/mobile app work carried out.
